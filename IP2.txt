Copyright—creation, ownership, moral rights.
Protection is automatic at creation; registration helps with evidence. Authors also hold moral rights (integrity/attribution) even if economic rights are assigned. Life + 70 years.

Fair dealing—permitted purposes.
Use without permission may be fair for research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism/review, news reporting—subject to fairness factors. 
Canada.ca

Patents—file before disclosure.
Patent term is 20 years; published 18 months after filing. Valuable for technical solutions; you can license or sell.

Trademarks—why register + process highlights.
Registration gives exclusive nationwide rights for 10 years (renewable). Canada participates in the Madrid Protocol for multi-country filings. (CIPO roadmap: opposition window after advertisement is 2 months.)

Industrial designs—“look” protection.
Register to protect the product’s visual features for up to 15 years (initial 5 years from registration, renewable periods thereafter). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Trade secrets—contract + controls.
No registration; protect value via confidentiality measures (NDAs, access controls). Loss of secrecy ends protection.

Enforcement & remedies (from Yates topics).
Rights holders can seek injunctions and damages (incl. statutory damages in some cases), and use special orders in serious cases; CIPO explains trademark infringement basics.

Concise Tutorial: How to Protect & Use IP (with the added topics)

1) Identify what you’ve created → map to the right IP tool

Invention/technical solution → Patent (20 years). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Brand name/logo/slogan/sound, etc. → Trademark (10-year terms, renewable). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Artwork, text, code, media → Copyright (life + 70). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Product “look” (shape/ornamentation/UI) → Industrial design (up to 15 years). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Confidential know-how/data/algorithms → Trade secret (lasts while secret). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

2) Before disclosure

Patents/Designs: avoid public disclosure until filed (patents publish at ~18 months). 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Trade secrets: put NDAs + access controls in place.

3) Search, then file (or lock down)

Patents: assess novelty; file early.

Industrial design: register within timelines; protection up to 15 years. 
ised-isde.canada.ca

Trade secret: document what’s secret; define who can access; use contracts.

4) Use, license, and monetize

All major IPs can be licensed (patents, marks, designs, copyrights); trademarks/copyrights often used in brand and content deals.

5) Know the copyright boundaries (added: fair dealing + moral rights)

Fair dealing may cover education/research/criticism/news/etc., but apply fairness factors (purpose, amount, effect, alternatives). 
Canada.ca

Moral rights (credit/integrity) stay with the author unless waived—separate from economic rights.

6) Enforce your rights

Trademarks: stop confusing uses; consider opposition during the 2-month window after advertisement.

All IP: typical remedies include injunctions and damages; CIPO outlines trademark infringement response steps.
